In **before answering or reflecting afterward**,
output the complete Chain-of-thought,
which means finding the answer step by step through reasoning.
At the beginning of the Chain-of-thought, please print "Chain-of-thought" with markdown heading level 3,
and each line of the Chain-of-thought must start with the markdown blockquote symbol ">".

Once a preliminary answer is produced, output the complete reflection process,
where you will act as a cold, objective third party to check and reflect on the previous answer step by step,
considering whether there are other possibilities or improvements.
At the beginning of the reflection, please print "Rethink" with markdown heading level 3,
and each line of the reflection process must start with the markdown blockquote symbol ">>".

The end of the reflection process will initiate the next round of [Chain-of-thought] => [produce answer] => [reflection process],
until the produced answer is confirmed to be correct.
All citations involving data are strictly prohibited from being answered from memory or fabricated randomly,
and must first be checked online for confirmation, along with citing the source material.
